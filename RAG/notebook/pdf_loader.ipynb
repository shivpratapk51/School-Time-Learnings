Since we assumed office 12 years ago, India’s economic trajectory \\nhas been marked by stability, fiscal discipline, sustained growth and \\nmoderate inflation. This is the result of conscious choices we have made, \\neven in times of heightened uncertainty and di sruption. Our \\nGovernment, led by Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi, has decisively and \\nconsistently chosen action over ambivalence, reform over rhetoric and \\npeople over populism.  \\n2. We have pursued far reaching structural reforms,  \\nfiscal prudence and monetary stability whilst  \\nmaintaining a strong thrust on public investment.   \\nKeeping atmanirbharta as a lodestar, we have built domestic \\nmanufacturing capacity, energy security and reduced critical import \\ndependencies.  Simultaneously, we have ensured that citizens benefit \\nfrom every action of the Government, undertaking reforms to support'),\n",

Today, we face an external environment in which trade and \\nmultilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains \\nare disrupted. New technologies are transforming production systems \\nwhile sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals.  \\n4. India will continue to take confident steps towards Viksit Bharat, \\nbalancing ambition with inclusion. As a growing economy with expanding \\ntrade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with \\nglobal markets, exporting more and attracting s table long -term \\ninvestment. \\n \\nPart A \\n5. As I begin Part A, I want to express my gratitude to the people for \\nstanding firmly with us as we forge our way together towards becoming \\none of the largest economies of the world. \\n6. Our aim is to transform aspiration into achievement and potential \\ninto performance, as we ensure that the dividends of growth reach every \\nfarmer, the scheduled caste, the scheduled tribes, the nomads, the youth, \\nthe poor and the women. \\n7. In the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026, several \\ninnovative ideas were shared with our Prime Minister, which have \\ninspired many of the proposals, making this a unique Yuva Shakti-driven \\nBudget.  \\n8. Our Government’s ‘Sankalp’ is to focus on our poor, \\nunderprivileged and the disadvantaged . To deliver on this Sankalp, and \\ngiven that this is the first Budget prepared in Kartavya Bhawan, we are \\ninspired by 3 kartavya:  \\n9. Our first kartavya is to accelerate and sustain economic growth, \\nby enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and building resilience to \\nvolatile global dynamics.'),\n",

Our second kartavya is to fulfil aspirations of our people and build \\ntheir capacity, making them strong partners in India’s path to prosperity. \\n11. Our third kartavya, aligned with our vision of Sabka Sath, Sabka \\nVikas, is to ensure that every family, community, region and sector has \\naccess to resources, amenities and opportunities for meaningful \\nparticipation.   \\n12. This threefold approach requires a supportive ecosystem. The first \\nrequirement is to sustain the momentum of structural reforms — \\ncontinuous, adaptive, and forward -looking. Second, a robust and \\nresilient financial sector is central to mobilising savings, allocating capital \\nefficiently and managing risks. Third, cutting-edge technologies, \\nincluding AI applications,  can serve as force multipliers for better \\ngovernance.  \\nReform Express \\n13. Our Government has undertaken comprehensive economic \\nreforms towards creating employment, boosting productivity and \\naccelerating growth. After the Prime Minister’s announcement on \\nIndependence Day in 2025, over 350 reforms have been rolled out. These \\ninclude GST simplification, notification of Labour Codes, and \\nrationalisation of mandatory Quality Control Orders. High Level \\nCommittees have been formed and in parallel, the Central Government \\nis working with the State Governments on deregulation and reducing \\ncompliance requirements.  \\n14. The Reform Express is well on its way and will maintain its \\nmomentum to help us fulfil our kartavya. \\nI now move to the specific proposals.  \\n15. Under our first kartavya to accelerate and sustain economic \\ngrowth, I propose interventions in six areas: i) Scaling up manufacturing \\nin 7 strategic and frontier sectors; ii) Rejuvenating legacy industrial \\nsectors; iii) Creating “Champion MSMEs”; iv) Delivering a powerful push \\nto Infrastructure; v) Ensuring long-term energy security and stability; and \\nvi) Developing City Economic Regions.'),\n",

Biopharma SHAKTI (Strategy for Healthcare Advancement \\nthrough Knowledge, Technology and Innovation) – India’s disease \\nburden is observed to be shifting towards non -communicable diseases, \\nlike diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disorders. Biologic medicines are \\nkey to longevity and quality of life at affordable costs. To develop India as \\na global Biopharma manufacturing hub, I propose the Biopharma SHAKTI \\nwith an outlay of ₹ 10,000 crores over the next 5 years. This will build the \\necosystem for domestic production of bio logics and biosimilars. The \\nStrategy will include a Biopharma -focused network with 3 new National \\nInstitutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) and \\nupgrading 7 existing ones. It will also create a network of over 1000 \\naccredited India Clinical Trials sites. We propose to strengthen the Central \\nDrugs Standard Control Organisation to meet global standards and \\napproval timeframes through a dedicated scientific review cadre and \\nspecialists. \\n17. India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)  1.0 expanded India’s \\nsemiconductor sector capabilities. Building on this,  \\nwe will launch ISM 2.0 to produce equipment and materials, design full -\\nstack Indian IP, and fortify supply chains. We will also focus on industry -\\nled research and training centres to develop technology and skilled \\nworkforce. \\n18. The Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme, launched in \\nApril 2025 with an outlay of ₹22,919 crore, already has investment \\ncommitments at double the target. We propose to increase the outlay to \\n₹40,000 crore to capitalise on the momentum.  \\n19. A Scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets was launched in \\nNovember 2025. We now propose to support the mineral -rich States of \\nOdisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish dedicated \\nRare Earth Corridors  to promote mining, processing, research and \\nmanufacturing. \\n20. To enhance domestic chemical production and reduce import -\\ndependency, we will launch a Scheme to support States in establishing 3 \\ndedicated Chemical Parks, through challenge route, on a cluster -based \\nplug-and-play model.'),\n",

Strong capital goods  capability is a determinant of productivity \\nand quality across different sectors. Towards building this capacity, I \\npropose the following: \\n(a) Hi-Tech Tool Rooms will be established by CPSEs at 2 locations \\nas digitally enabled automated service bureaus that locally \\ndesign, test, and manufacture high -precision components at \\nscale and at lower cost. \\n(b) A Scheme for  Enhancement of Construction and \\nInfrastructure Equipment (CIE) will be introduced to \\nstrengthen domestic manufacturing of high -value and \\ntechnologically-advanced CIE. This can range from lifts in a \\nmulti-story apartment, fire -fighting equipment, large and \\nsmall, to tunnel-boring equipment for building metros and \\nhigh-altitude roads.  \\n(c) I also propose a Scheme for Container Manufacturing to \\ncreate a globally competitive container manufacturing \\necosystem, with a budgetary allocation of ₹10,000 crore over \\na 5 year period.   \\n22. For the labour -intensive Textile Sector , I propose an Integrated \\nProgramme with 5 sub-parts: \\n(a) The National Fibre Scheme for self -reliance  \\nin natural fibres such as silk, wool and jute,  \\nman-made fibres, and new-age fibres; \\n(b) Textile Expansion and Employment Scheme to modernise \\ntraditional clusters with capital support for machinery, \\ntechnology upgradation and common testing and \\ncertification centres;  \\n(c) A National Handloom and Handicraft programme to integrate \\nand strengthen existing schemes and ensure targeted \\nsupport for weavers and artisans; \\n(d) Tex-Eco Initiative to promote  globally competitive and \\nsustainable textiles and apparels;'),\n",

Further, I propose to set up Mega Textile Parks in challenge mode. \\nThey can also focus on bringing value addition to technical textiles.   \\n24. I propose to launch the Mahatma Gandhi Gram Swaraj initiative \\nto strengthen khadi, handloom and handicrafts. This will help in global \\nmarket linkage and branding. It will streamline and support training, \\nskilling, quality of process and production. This wi ll benefit our weavers,  \\nvillage industries, One - District – One - Product initiative and rural youth.  \\n25. India has the potential to emerge as a global hub for high quality, \\naffordable sports goods. I propose a dedicated initiative for sports goods \\nthat will promote manufacturing, research and innovation in equipment \\ndesign as well as material sciences.  \\nRejuvenation of Legacy Industrial Clusters  \\n26. I propose to introduce a Scheme to revive 200 legacy industrial \\nclusters to improve their cost competitiveness and efficiency through \\ninfrastructure and technology upgradation. \\nCreating “Champion SMEs” and supporting micro enterprises: \\n27. Recognising MSMEs as a vital engine of growth, I propose a three-\\npronged approach to help them grow as ‘Champions’: \\nEquity Support  \\n28. I propose to introduce a dedicated ₹10,000 crore  SME Growth \\nFund, to create future Champions, incentivizing enterprises based on \\nselect criteria. \\n29.

With TReDS, more than ₹7 lakh crore has been made available to \\nMSMEs. To leverage its full potential, I propose 4 measures: (i) mandate \\nTReDS as the transaction settlement platform for all purchases from \\nMSMEs by CPSEs, serving as a benchmark for other corporates; (ii) \\nintroduce a credit guarantee support mechanism through CGTMSE for \\ninvoice discounting on TReDS platform; (iii) link GeM with TReDS for \\nsharing information with financiers about government purchases from \\nMSMEs, encouraging cheaper and quicker financing; (iv) introduce TReDS \\nreceivables as asset -backed securities, helping develop a secondary \\nmarket, enhancing liquidity and settlement of transactions. \\nProfessional Support  \\n31. Government will facilitate Professional Institutions such as ICAI, \\nICSI, ICMAI to design short -term, modular courses and practical tools to \\ndevelop a cadre of ‘Corporate Mitras’, especially in Tier -II and Tier -III \\ntowns. These accredited para -professionals will help MSMEs meet \\ncompliance requirements at affordable costs.  \\nInfrastructure \\n32. During this past decade our Government has undertaken several \\ninitiatives for large-scale enhancement of public infrastructure including \\nthrough new financing instruments such as Infrastructure Investment \\nTrusts (InVITs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and institutions \\nlike NIIF and NABFID. We shall continue to focus on developing \\ninfrastructure in cities with over 5 lakh population (Tier II and Tier III), \\nwhich have expanded to become growth centres.  \\n33. Public capex  has increased manifold from ₹2 lakh crore in  \\nFY2014-15 to an allocation of ₹11.2 lakh crore in  \\nBE 2025-26. In FY2026-27, I propose to increase it to ₹12.2 lakh crore to \\ncontinue the momentum. \\n34. To strengthen the confidence of private developers regarding \\nrisks during infrastructure development and construction phase, I \\npropose to set up an Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund to provide \\nprudently calibrated partial credit guarantees to lenders.'),\n",

To promote environmentally sustainable movement of cargo, I \\npropose to: a) Establish new Dedicated Freight Corridors  connecting \\nDankuni in the East, to Surat in the West; b) o perationalise 20 new \\nNational Waterways  (NW) over next 5 years, starting with NW -5 in \\nOdisha to connect mineral rich areas of Talcher and Angul and industrial \\ncentres like Kalinga Nagar to the Ports of Paradeep and Dhamra. Training \\nInstitutes will be set up as Regional Centres of Excellence for \\ndevelopment of the required manpower. Thi s will benefit youth in the \\nentire stretch of the waterways to train and acquire skills.  \\nFurther, a ship repair ecosystem  catering to inland waterways will also \\nbe set up at Varanasi and Patna; c) launch a Coastal Cargo Promotion \\nScheme for incentivising a modal shift from rail and road, to increase the \\nshare of inland waterways and coastal shipping from 6 % to 12 % by 2047.  \\n37. To enhance last -mile and remote connectivity, and promote \\ntourism, I propose to give incentives to indigenize manufacturing of \\nseaplanes. A Seaplane VGF Scheme will be also be introduced to provide \\nsupport for operations. \\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) \\n38. Aligning with the roadmap launched in December 2025, CCUS \\ntechnologies at scale will achieve higher readiness levels in end -use \\napplications across five industrial sectors, including, power, steel, \\ncement, refineries and chemicals.  An outlay of ₹20,000 crore is proposed \\nover the next 5 years.  \\nCity Economic Regions  \\n39. Cities are India’s engines of growth, innovation, and \\nopportunities.

At this juncture, we are well -\\nplaced to futuristically evaluate the measures needed to continue on the \\npath of reform-led growth of this sector. \\n42. I propose setting up a “High Level Committee on Banking for \\nViksit Bharat” , to comprehensively review the sector and align it with \\nIndia’s next phase of growth, while safeguarding financial stability, \\ninclusion and consumer protection. \\n43. The vision for NBFCs for Viksit Bharat has been outlined with clear \\ntargets for credit disbursement and technology adoption. In order to \\nachieve scale and improve efficiency in the Public Sector NBFCs, as a first \\nstep, it is proposed to restructure the Power Finance Corporation and \\nRural Electrification Corporation.  \\n44. I propose a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange \\nManagement (Non -debt Instruments) Rules  to create a more \\ncontemporary, user -friendly framework for foreign investments, \\nconsistent with India’s evolving economic priorities.  \\nCorporate Bond Market \\n45. I propose to introduce a market making framework with suitable \\naccess to funds and derivatives on corporate bond indices. I also propose \\nto introduce total return swaps on corporate bonds.  \\nMunicipal Bonds \\n46. To encourage the issuance of municipal bonds of higher value by \\nlarge cities, I propose an incentive of ₹100 crore for a single bond issuance'),\n",

Multiplicity of proceedings are a hindrance to the ease of \\ndoing business. I propose to integrate assessment & penalty \\nproceedings by way of a common order for both. There will be no \\ninterest liability on the taxpayer on the penalty amount for the period \\nof appeal before the first appellate authority irrespective of the \\noutcome of appeal proc ess. Further, quantum of pre -payment is \\nbeing reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent and will continue to be \\ncalculated only on core tax demand. \\n114. As an additional measure for reducing litigation,  \\nI propose to allow taxpayers to update their returns even after \\nreassessment proceedings have been initiated, at an additional 10 \\npercent tax rate over and above the rate applicable for the relevant \\nyear. The assessing officer will then use only this updat ed return in \\nhis proceedings. \\n115. There is already a framework for immunity from penalty and \\nprosecution in the cases of underreporting. I propose to apply this \\nframework of immunity to misreporting too. However, in such a case \\nthe taxpayer will need to pay 100 percent of the tax amount as an \\nadditional income tax over and above the tax and interest due. \\n116. Penalties for certain technical defaults such as failure to get \\naccounts audited, non-furnishing of transfer pricing audit report and \\ndefault in furnishing statement for financial transactions, are \\nproposed to be converted into fee. \\n117. I propose to rationalise prosecution framework under the \\nIncome Tax Act while maintaining a careful balance for deterrence in \\nsome serious offences.  \\n118. Non-production of books of account and documents, and \\nrequirement of TDS payment, where payment is made in kind, are \\nbeing decriminalised. Further, minor offences will attract fine only.  \\n119. The remaining prosecutions will be graded commensurate \\nwith the quantum of offence. They will entail only simple \\nimprisonment, with maximum imprisonment reduced to two years, \\nand power to courts to convert even those into fine.'),\n",

There is no penalty presently for non -disclosure of non -\\nimmovable foreign assets with aggregate value less than 20 lakh \\nrupees.

Deduction is already allowed to a primary cooperative society \\nengaged in supplying milk, oilseeds, fruits or vegetables raised or \\ngrown by its members. I propose to extend this deduction to also \\ninclude supply of cattle feed and cotton seed produced by its  \\nmembers.  \\n122.

I further propose to allow exemption for a period  \\nof 3 years, to dividend income received by a notified national co -\\noperative federation, on their investments made in companies up to \\n31.1.2026. This exemption would be allowed only for dividends \\nfurther distributed to its member co-operatives. \\nSupporting IT sector as India’s growth engine \\n124. India is a global leader in software development services, IT \\nenabled services, knowledge process outsourcing services and \\ncontract R&D services relating to software development. These \\nbusiness segments are quite inter-connected with each other.  \\n125. All these services are proposed to be clubbed under a single \\ncategory of Information Technology Services  \\nwith a common safe harbour margin of 15.5 percent applicable to all.  \\n126. The threshold for availing safe harbour for IT services is being \\nenhanced substantially from 300 crore rupees to 2,000 crore rupees. \\n127. Safe harbour for IT services shall be approved by an \\nautomated rule-driven process without any need for tax officer to \\nexamine and accept the application. Once applied by an IT Services \\ncompany, the same safe harbour can be continued for a period of 5 \\nyears at a stretch at its choice.'),\n",

To harness the efficiency of just-in-time logistics for electronic \\nmanufacturing, I propose to provide safe harbour to non -residents \\nfor component warehousing in a bonded warehouse at a profit \\nmargin of 2 percent of the invoice value. The resultant tax of about \\n0.7 percent will be much lower than in competing jurisdictions. \\n133. To provide fillip to toll manufacturing in India,  \\nI propose to provide exemption from income tax  \\nfor 5 years, to any non -resident who provides capital goods, \\nequipment or tooling, to any toll manufacturer in a bonded zone. \\n134. To encourage vast pool of global talent to work in India for a \\nlonger period of time, I propose to provide exemption to global (non-\\nIndia sourced) income of a non-resident expert, for a stay period of 5 \\nyears under notified schemes. \\n135.

To support PM Modi’s vision of home -grown accounting and \\nadvisory firms to become global leaders, I propose to rationalise the \\ndefinition of accountant for the purposes of Safe Harbour Rules. \\nOther Tax proposals \\n138. Change in taxation of buyback was brought in to address the \\nimproper use of buyback route by promoters. In the interest of \\nminority shareholders, I propose to tax buyback for all types of \\nshareholders as Capital Gains. However, to disincentivize misuse of \\ntax arbitrage, promoters will pay an additional buyback tax. This will \\nmake effective tax 22 percent for corporate promoters. For non -\\ncorporate promoters the effective tax will be 30 percent. \\n139.

Key recommendations of the \\nCommission include: \\n▪ Share of states in central taxes:  The 16th \\nCommission (FC) has recommended the share of \\nstates in the divisible pool of central taxes at 41%.  \\nDivisible pool is arrived at after excluding cost of \\ncollection and cesses and surcharges from the gross \\ntax revenue collected by the central government.  \\nThe share remains unchanged from the 15th Finance \\nCommission award period (2021-26). \\n▪ Devolution Criteria:  To determine distribution of \\ncentral taxes among states, the Finance \\nCommissions come up with a formula with \\nweightage for certain parameters.  The 16th FC has \\ngiven the highest weightage to income distance \\n(Table 9).  Income distance is the distance of a \\nstate’s per capita GSDP from the state with the \\nhighest per capita GSDP.  On this parameter, a state \\nwith lower per capita GSDP will have a higher \\nshare in devolution to maintain equity among states.  \\nThe 15th FC had also used this criterion with a \\ncomparatively higher weightage. \\n▪ The 16th FC has introduced a new parameter which \\naccounts for the contribution to national GDP.  This \\nreplaces the tax and fiscal efforts parameter used by \\nthe 15th FC which rewarded states with a higher tax \\ncollection efficiency.  Contribution to GDP has also \\nbeen given a comparatively higher weightage. \\n▪ Other parameters include population, area, and \\nforest cover.  These parameters are similar to the \\n15th FC.  Weightage for area has been reduced. \\n▪ Grants-in-aid:  The 16th FC has recommended \\ngrants worth Rs 9.47 lakh crore over the five-year \\nperiod.  These comprise grants for: (i) urban and \\nrural local bodies, and (ii) disaster management.  \\nThe 16th FC has discontinued the following grants \\nrecommended by the 15th FC: (i) revenue deficit \\ngrants, (ii) sector-specific grants for education, \\njustice, statistics, and agriculture, and (iii) state-\\nspecific grants. \\nTable 9: Criteria for devolution \\nCriteria 14th FC \\n2015-20 \\n15th FC \\n2021-26 \\n16th FC \\n2026-31 \\nIncome Distance 50.0 45.0 42.5 \\nArea 15.0 15.0 10.0 \\nPopulation (1971) 17.5 - - \\nPopulation (2011) 10.0 15.0 17.5 \\nDemographic Performance# - 12.5 10.0 \\nForest^ 7.5 10.0 10.0 \\nTax and fiscal effort - 2.5 - \\nContribution to GDP - - 10.0 \\nTotal 100 100 100 \\nNote: #rewards efforts made by states in controlling their population relative to 1971 \\npopulation.   \\n^The 14th and 15th FC accounted for the share in moderately dense and very dense \\nforest cover.
